* **Who are the founders of the company?**

Rene Reinsberg, Sep Kamvar and Marek Olszewski

* **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**

The idea to set up this company came about following the realisation that a large number of people in the world are not prosperous due to the lack of financial inclusion and the inability to access the financial system and its services.

## Business Activities:

* **What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

The platform was created initially to address the problem of financial exclusion. 1.7 billion people around the world lack access to financial services making it harder to build a path towards prosperity.

* **Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**

The company's initial intended customer base is 1.7 billion people predominantly in emerging markets who are not connected to the financial system but have recently acquired access to a mobile phone and are hence connected to the internet. The company has set up an ecosytem to achieve this goal which includes a blockchain platform for developers to build dApps, a stablecoin currency, a payments and remittance app, a crypto wallet which is an application for exchange of funds conversion between celo and its  native stablecoin and a non-profit organisation The Celo Foundation to assist people in those parts of the world it is trying to market its product.

* **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information)**

Using a novel address-based encryption algorithm, Celo makes sending money as easy as sending a text. Celo also uses stable-value tokens pegged to fiat currencies, like the US Dollar, to minimize volatility of payments. The first application launching on the platform is a social payments and money transfer app, aimed at developing markets.

Celo maps phone numbers to wallet addresses using a novel decentralized address-based encryption algorithm.

• Celo Blockchain: An open cryptographic protocol that allows applications to make transactions with and run smart contracts in a secure and decentralized fashion. The Celo Blockchain code has shared ancestry with Ethereum, and maintains full EVM compatibility for smart contracts. However it uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism rather than Proof of Work, and has different block format, transaction format, client synchronization protocols, and gas payment and pricing mechanisms.

• Celo Core Contracts: A set of smart contracts running on the Celo Blockchain that comprise much of the logic of the platform features including ERC-20 stable currencies, identity attestations, proof-of-stake and governance. These smart contracts are upgradeable and managed by the decentralized governance process.

• Applications: Applications for end users built on the Celo platform. The Celo Wallet app, the first of an ecosystem of applications, allows end users to manage accounts and make payments securely and simply by taking advantage of the innovations in the Celo protocol. Applications take the form of external mobile or backend software: they interact with the Celo Blockchain to issue transactions and invoke code that forms the Celo Core Contracts’ API. Third parties can also deploy custom smart contracts that their own applications can invoke, which in turn can leverage Celo Core Contracts. Applications may use centralized cloud services to provide some of their functionality: in the case of the Celo Wallet, push notifications and a transaction activity feed.
The Celo Blockchain and Celo Core Contracts together comprise the Celo Protocol.

## Landscape:

* **What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

Decentralized finance on mobile platform. This includes an open-source blockchain platform for the creation of smart contracts and the development of dApp, a US pegged stablecoin, and a mobile payment app for transfer or crypto using mobile number. 

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?**

Defi has been growing and changing dramatically over the last few years. Some of the major trends have been the emergence of borrowing and lending on decentralized platforms, decentralized exchanges for trading securities and cryptocurrencies, insurance markets and prediction markets in a completed automated way using real time data and use of algorithms for predictions.

* **What are the other major companies in this domain?**

Celo's aim is to build a flexible network of applications built on a blockchain to facilitate payments and remittances to people's phone numbers, using a mobile-first approach. It's closest competitor would have been the Libra / Diem digital currency created by Facebook as a medium of exchange backed by a basket of assets. It's biggest advantage being a captive membership base of 2 billion people on its network already. Libra / Diem has already been in trouble with the regulators and given Facebook's reputation regarding data privacy, the project has stalled with a possible relaunch due in late 2021.

## Results

* **What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

It's still early days for Celo and it's organisation cLabs which is focused on building the platform on which developers around the world can start building Defi apps. In February 2021, cLabs launched Valora, the first mobile remittance and peer-to-peer payments app built on the celo platform. So far 25k users have adopted the app in more than 100 countries. This app was also used to provide COVID - 19 cash relief through Blockchain Technology in partnership with Grameen Foundation to 3500 women entrepreneurs across the Philippines.

* **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**

Celo’s mission is focused on promoting prosperity by meeting basic needs, enabling growth potential, and / or increasing social support. The team working on Celo has adopted metrics within each objective that they will track as Celo evolves. The objectives and metrics are:

Objective #1: Increase the number of people whose basic needs are met

	• # of Celo users lifted above the poverty line
	• $ amount of humanitarian aid sent via Celo
	• # of cash transfer programs and humanitarian aid programs using Celo
	• Active ecosystems (i.e. cash-in and cash-out options) in market

Objective #2: Individuals are able to grow along their own path

	• # People provided new access to decentralized finance tools (e.g. measured via surveys)
	• # Active user base in across all countries
	• # of people working on / building on Celo

Objective #3: People are supporting each other

	• % reduction in avg. transaction costs for P2P payment
	• # P2P transactions in EM countries
	• Celo community growth
	• # community-organized Celo meetups
	• # projects building on Celo
	• (Net Promoter Score) Celo team and contributors feel ownership

The organisation has grown steadily over the last 12 months on several fronts including the launch of payment app Valora, Covid19 relief programs, Celo Dollars launch, increase in active developers and Celo Platform transactions and assets on month to month basis. As its still early days for the company, the metrics through which Celo measures its success are still being refined.

* **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

Given the current setup of Celo and cLabs is quite unique and it has its own platform and ecosystem, it is hard to compare it other organisations. From a currency ecosystem perspective, Diem / Libra comes close but its launch keeps getting delayed for a variety of reasons.


## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**

Celo and cLabs could create mobile focused Defi apps for micro-lending and micro-insurance and link them to the payments app Valora which will create its own unique financial ecosystem to support low income communities across the world. This will provide directs access to insurance and lending products along with remittance ease to people who usually don't have much assets to provide as collateral and hence remain unbanked and out of the financial system.

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

Given the sheer number of people that are not part of the financial system, providing these products to them will help expand the company really quickly and help them scale and capture the market. Given the existing infrastructure and platform in place already, this will keep them ahead of any emerging competitor which already has a captive market in terms of the number of users for eg Facebook.

* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

Setting up Dapps for micro-insurance and micro-lending will require blockchain, use of smart contracts and a stablecoin for remittance and tracking user activity, all of which are already available on the Celo platform. All that's required now is the creation of dApps on the Celo platform and marketing and scaling them to people who need it.

* **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

The use of smart contracts for lending and insurance will remove the middlemen and will help provide financial access to people who historically have not been granted loans / capital. Smart contracts via mobile platform will help provide loans without an application review or even a bank account. Borrowers can stake their digital assets as collateral which will be locked within a smart contract until the loan is repaid.
